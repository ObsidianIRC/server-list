# ObsidianIRC's Servers List
This is where ObsidianIRC's server list on the 'Discover' reads from.

### So, how do you get listed? It's so easy!
## Making a PR (Pull Request)
If you already know GitHub, you know what to do! 😉

If not, all you need to do is edit this file, add your server in using the same format as the rest (JSON) of the servers, and then click to make a Pull Request from your newly created fork! 😁
## Does The Change Happen Immediately?
No, you will have to wait for one of our team to review your Pull Request. This should take a few hours, but may take a few days.

We appreciate your patience so much!
## What If I Made A Mistake?
Don't worry, we've got you! If you make an obvious mistake in the JSON syntax, we will just politely fix it for you! 😁

And if you left out something that's required, we'll let you know by commenting on your Pull Request.
